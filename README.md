# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This is the "Rock Paper Scissors" project for the Java Fundamentls class in Soft Uni, of course, has a twist - it takes the version of the game from the television show "The Big Bang Theory". I have also added a few more interesting twists - the game is endless (unless, the player choses to do so), it has a score counter, and declares a final winer of all games (also keeps statistics on the wins and losses of the game)
-
This is a console based game that puts you against chance!
-
The premise of this version of the game is simple:

#Input and Output
-
You write the starting letter/s:
-
-r/rock for Rock
-p/paper for Paper
-s/scissors for Scissors
-l/lizard for Lizard
-sp/spock for Spock.
-
It is not case sensitive, so even with CapsLock on it should not be a problem.
-
The Game ends only when the users types "End"(again not case sensitive).
